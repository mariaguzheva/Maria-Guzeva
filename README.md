# Smart Waste Sorting Assistant

## Summary
This project aims to develop an AI-powered assistant that helps users correctly sort their waste into different categories (e.g., plastic, paper, organic, glass, general waste). By using image recognition, the system will identify waste items and provide instant sorting recommendations.

## Background
Mis-sorting waste is a common problem globally, leading to inefficiencies in recycling processes, contamination of recyclable materials, and increased landfill waste. This issue contributes to environmental degradation and resource depletion. Personally, I've often found myself unsure about where to dispose of certain items, especially packaging with multiple materials or obscure labels. This project is important because improving waste sorting at the individual level can significantly boost recycling rates and promote a circular economy.

* Problem 1: Low recycling rates due to improper sorting.
* Problem 2: Contamination of recyclable waste streams.
* Problem 3: Lack of knowledge among consumers about correct waste disposal.

## How is it used?
The solution would be a mobile application or a web-based tool. A user would simply take a picture of a waste item using their smartphone camera. The application would then process the image using a trained AI model and display the recommended waste category (e.g., "Plastic," "Compost," "Landfill").

This solution is needed in various environments:
* **At home:** For daily household waste sorting.
* **In public spaces:** For visitors unsure about local recycling rules.
* **In offices or schools:** To educate and assist employees/students in proper waste disposal.

The primary users would be individuals who want to sort their waste correctly but lack the knowledge or time to research each item. The app needs to be user-friendly, fast, and provide clear, unambiguous recommendations. It should also account for varying local recycling guidelines.
